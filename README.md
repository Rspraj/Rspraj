🌟 Hi, I'm Raj Patel
Data Scientist | ML Engineer | Automation Specialist | AI Solutions Builder

I transform complex business problems into automated, scalable, and intelligent solutions.
My work blends machine learning, LLM automation, Python engineering, and data pipelines to drive real business impact — especially in insurance tech.

🚀 What I Do

🔧 Build production-grade AI automations (LLM pipelines, Python, Playwright, Service Bus).

🤖 Develop ML models for pricing, clustering, forecasting, and customer insights.

📊 Create end-to-end data solutions — ingestion, cleaning, modeling, reporting.

🛠 Build internal tools that save thousands of manual hours across teams.

🏆 Highlighted Projects
